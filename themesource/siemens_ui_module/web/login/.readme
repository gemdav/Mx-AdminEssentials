The files in this folder can be used to overwrite the login.html files in theme, in case e.g. anonymous users are not allowed in your project and you need a different way of login.

1. Copy and paste the custom folder, custom_login.scss and login.html to theme > web.
2. Add the following code to main.scss in theme: @import "custom_login";
3. Synchronize the App Directory in your Mendix Studio Pro project and Run the project locally.
4. View the login screen in the browser by clicking on "View App" or by adding "/login.html" at the end of the URL. The URL should look something like this: "http://localhost:8080/login.html"
5. You can replace the Placeholder Application Icon in theme > web > custom > resources with one that suits your project. Also, you can change the Application Name in theme > web > login.html (on line 29). Follow step 3 and 4 again to see your changes.
